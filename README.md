# AI does AI Episode 1: Text Summarization and Transformers
This repository is a supplement to my video on Transformers and Text Summarization as part of my series AI does AI (https://youtu.be/p_6xgrykPMQ)

👁 The focus of this particular video and project was to learn about various Machine Learning models that are well suited for sequential data and then implement them in the context of text summarization. 

🤖 The models used in this project are XLNet, Google's T5, and OpenAI's GPT-2 all thanks to huggingface.co! Make sure to check them out!
